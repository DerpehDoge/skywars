oh hi this is a map made by some idots kthxbye


download the map using the releases shown on the right side

if you want to get the most recent version (commits), you can download the entire repo as a ZIP,
extract all,
take the inner folder out of the extracted folder
send the folder you just took out to a compressed ZIP. you can do this by right clicking, finding "Send to...", hovering and clicking ZIP.
After you zip it, be sure to change the .zip to .mcworld

if you know your git stuff
you can clone the git repo into the worlds folder
you can create a new world, then just copy the name. you can delete the world afterwards.
after you do this, if you want to update the world, you can git pull. this will overwrite your world, however.
